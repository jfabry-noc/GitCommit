      <h2>2021 Commits</h2>
			<!-- Watermark -->
	<h3>LogicMonitorGroovy</h3>
	<p>Renamed the file for health notices to reflect that was the use. Replaced the conditional logic from the last commit for removing the : from the timezone offset in the creation timestamp for each notice with a regex.</p>
	<p class="date">01/18/2021 15:47:49</p>

	<h3>LogicMonitorGroovy</h3>
	<p>Created a DataSource for getting the health notices from an rXg. Implemented the ability to query for all notices, along with code to reformat the creation date timestamp and parse to a Date object for comparison.</p>
	<p class="date">01/15/2021 21:31:55</p>

	<h3>LogicMonitorGroovy</h3>
	<p>Added the basline code for querying the total number of concurrent licenses on the platform. Checks if the licensing is standalone or clustered. Captures the peak concurrent usage over the past 10 minutes and reports on the highest value.</p>
	<p class="date">01/14/2021 21:58:22</p>

	<h3>LogicMonitorGroovy</h3>
	<p>Created a script to parse out the certificate details for an rXg. The end date of the certificate's validity is compared to the current date, and the number of days remaining (or passed) are reported to LogicMonitor for alerting.</p>
	<p class="date">01/14/2021 14:46:31</p>

	<h3>LogicMonitorGroovy</h3>
	<p>Added a discovery script to exclude APs and get only switches from XIQ. The device IDs are passed to a collector script which then dumps the switch configuration into LogicMonitor.</p>
	<p class="date">01/13/2021 19:03:37</p>

	<h3>LogicMonitorGroovy</h3>
	<p>Modified the URL parsing for the script getting the SSID config of each device to match the parsing for the device discovery so that each cloud host and VIQID is accounted for.</p>
	<p class="date">01/13/2021 15:21:37</p>
	<h3>LogicMonitorGroovy</h3>
	<p>Updated the URL from being hard-coded to account for both the cloud hosting the XIQ instance and applying the appropriate VIQID needed for all calls.</p>
	<p class="date">01/13/2021 15:11:30</p>
	<h3>jfabry-noc.github.io</h3>
	<p>Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/jfabry-noc/jfabry-noc.github.io</p>
	<p class="date">01/13/2021 14:16:12</p>
	<h3>jfabry-noc.github.io</h3>
	<p>Modified the first paragraph to match the content at https://unusually.pink/about/</p>
	<p class="date">01/13/2021 14:15:20</p>

	<h3>LogicMonitorPwsh</h3>
	<p>Added a new conditonal for a specific customer match to check data regardless of modem status.</p>
	<p class="date">01/12/2021 21:23:06</p>

	<h3>DeskTickets</h3>
	<p>Moved the writing of the .csv files to a function. Added an additional function to handle the deletion of existing .csv files prior to writing new ones to avoid manual cleanup prior to subsequent runs of the script.</p>
	<p class="date">01/11/2021 18:45:04</p>
	<h3>DeskTickets</h3>
	<p>Moved both accounts and agents to use the same object type. Added code to write a .csv file for each of the 4 lists created if the list contains content. Placed those into a results folder which has been excluded in the .gitignore file.</p>
	<p class="date">01/11/2021 16:14:51</p>

	<h3>DeskTickets</h3>
	<p>Added logic for tickets matching the first comparison year to gather account and agent details for each, including the ability to account for tickets where account or agent information wasn't supplied.</p>
	<p class="date">01/08/2021 22:18:54</p>

	<h3>DeskTickets</h3>
	<p>Added a function to iterate through all pages to return every ticket in the instance.</p>
	<p class="date">01/08/2021 16:54:14</p>
	<h3>DeskTickets</h3>
	<p>Added an untracked file for the API configuration. Created a function for POSTing to Desk to get an authentication token that will be used with subsequent queries.</p>
	<p class="date">01/08/2021 16:18:21</p>

	<h3>DeskTickets</h3>
	<p>Initial commit</p>
	<p class="date">01/08/2021 15:36:33</p>

	<h3>O365Logins</h3>
	<p>Modified the recipient email to the DL which will receive the messages long-term. Updated the filtering of the accounts to prevent the inclusion of known service accounts that are accessed via delegation rather than direct login.</p>
	<p class="date">01/07/2021 15:21:09</p>

	<h3>O365Logins</h3>
	<p>Manually removed the __pycache__ directory since I forgot to do it when I added it to the .gitignore file.</p>
	<p class="date">01/06/2021 22:19:39</p>
	<h3>O365Logins</h3>
	<p>Added __pycache__/ to the .gitignore.</p>
	<p class="date">01/06/2021 22:17:03</p>
	<h3>O365Logins</h3>
	<p>Added additional checks for whether the account is a guest and if it has licensing assigned. The licensing assignment check weeds out shared mailboxes and resource mailboxes. Added an import for my send_email function from an external module and added code leveraging that to send an email with a table of results to a recipient value.</p>
	<p class="date">01/06/2021 22:15:21</p>
	<h3>O365Logins</h3>
	<p>Added a function to query for the single audit log entry for each user. Added code to parse together the HTML body for the email that would be sent in an instance where there is a hit. The audit log is finite, so accounts with no audit log entry are set to the maximum audit log threshold of 90 days.</p>
	<p class="date">01/06/2021 21:31:33</p>

	<h3>LogicMonitorGroovy</h3>
	<p>Replaced a standardized email address for ticket filtering with an updated one the customer is now using.</p>
	<p class="date">01/06/2021 16:06:51</p>

	<h3>O365Logins</h3>
	<p>Added code for logging the activity of the script since it will run unattended as a cron job once completed. Included supplementary function for backing up the log file on the local file system once it grows too large. Added functions for getting an authentication token from the Microsoft Graph and validating that token. Created a function for querying the Graph for data, and then code calling that function to return the entire list of users in the tenant.</p>
	<p class="date">01/05/2021 23:35:51</p>
	<h3>O365Logins</h3>
	<p>Added a baseline .gitignore file for Python projects.</p>
	<p class="date">01/05/2021 22:38:39</p>
	<h3>GitCommit</h3>
	<p>Also modified the relative link to the header image in the 2020 page.</p>
	<p class="date">01/05/2021 22:36:31</p>
	<h3>GitCommit</h3>
	<p>Fixed the relative links to the CSS in the 2020 page.</p>
	<p class="date">01/05/2021 22:35:48</p>
	<h3>GitCommit</h3>
	<p>Copied all 2020 commits to a dedicated 2020 page. Removed the 2020 commit content from the main page and changed the heading to indicate that it was for 2021 commits. Added links to the 2020 and 2021 commits in the footer. Modified the image at the top of the page to link to the main index.</p>
	<p class="date">01/05/2021 22:34:05</p>
	<h3>O365Logins</h3>
	<p>Initial commit</p>
	<p class="date">01/05/2021 22:26:31</p>
