      <h2>2020 Commits</h2>
			<!-- Watermark -->
		<h3>O365MalwareAlerts</h3>
		<p>Added a check for an existing result file and removing it prior to starting anything else.</h3>
		<p class="date">11/05/2020 16:27:23</p>
		<h3>O365MalwareAlerts</h3>
		<p>Shifted the script to be designed for running as a Scheduled Task or cron job rather than by LogicMonitor directly due to the authentication requirements. Added logging.</h3>
		<p class="date">11/05/2020 16:11:27</p>

		<h3>O365MalwareAlerts</h3>
		<p>Created a new script file for querying the O365 quarantine for messages filtered there via transport rule. The script will validate that the appropriate transport rule caught the message (not filterable in the original call) and then report back how many users have received phishing messages blocked this way. Handles the metrics on a month-to-date basis.</h3>
		<p class="date">11/04/2020 20:20:44</p>

		<h3>CPPushAPI</h3>
		<p>Added the baseline files that were created for generic webhook listener testing. Also included the sample nginx.conf file for Gunicorn as the Flask + Nginx serving combo.</h3>
		<p class="date">11/04/2020 15:03:08</p>
		<h3>CPPushAPI</h3>
		<p>Initial commit</h3>
		<p class="date">11/04/2020 12:55:47</p>

		<h3>GitCommit</h3>
		<p>Removed redundant logging when querying each repo for commits. Modified the HTML generation to stop adding an extra newline to the end of the HTML file each time. Removed a repeated line in the HTML file because I forgot how daylight saving time works.</h3>
		<p class="date">11/03/2020 13:07:07</p>

		<h3>GitCommit</h3>
		<p>Modified the script to allow for commit messages on the GitCommit repo itself if they aren't the ones automatically generated for the sake of CI/CD to Netlify.</h3>
		<p class="date">11/02/2020 22:55:35</p>
		<h3>GitCommit</h3>
		<p>Modified to remove a commit that will become duplicate due to my testing. Again because of the fact that I can't do block comments, apparently.</h3>
		<p class="date">11/02/2020 21:35:59</p>
		<h3>GitCommit</h3>
		<p>Fixed yet another bug introduced by my inability to do block comments.</h3>
		<p class="date">11/02/2020 21:33:41</p>
		<h3>GitCommit</h3>
		<p>Addressed a bug where I was erroneously doing an extra comparison for the time. This was code from prior to when the filter was applied to the URL. Any returned commits should be considered valid if my account is the author.</h3>
		<p class="date">11/02/2020 21:31:00</p>
		<h3>LogicMonitorGroovy</h3>
		<p>Updated the Desk metrics to temporarily include the customer's internal blackhole alias.</h3>
		<p class="date">11/02/2020 21:17:56</p>
		<h3>LogicMonitorGroovy</h3>
		<p>Modified the EventSource and corresponding URL filter to account for the job running every 15 minutes rather than every 30 minutes. The time variable is in milliseconds.</h3>
		<p class="date">11/02/2020 20:52:56</p>
		<h3>jfabry-noc.github.io</h3>
		<p>Added a new link to gitcommit.gay and updated the CSS to include the alternate GitHub icon for it.</h3>
		<p class="date">10/31/2020 18:11:00</p>

		<h3>CPSpeedTests</h3>
		<p>Moved the default timeframe from 60 seconds to a 20 second duration.</h3>
		<p class="date">10/30/2020 20:58:51</p>

		<h3>OxidizedBackup</h3>
		<p>Created processing for each child directory in the SharePoint root, correlating it with the hostname of the Dashboard. If there is a match, parse together the new SharePoint URL for uploading the backup tarball and clearing out old tarballs.</h3>
		<p class="date">10/29/2020 20:40:38</p>
		<h3>OxidizedBackup</h3>
		<p>Added the ability to query the MS Graph for the contents of a SharePoint directory.</h3>
		<p class="date">10/29/2020 18:48:45</p>
		<h3>OxidizedBackup</h3>
		<p>Added skeleton code for handling a connection to the MS Graph and checking the validity of a Graph token. Also added to the repository the Python MSAL package and the dependencies for it.</h3>
		<p class="date">10/29/2020 17:41:13</p>
		<h3>LogicMonitorPwsh</h3>
		<p>Modified the hourly collection script to execute every 15 minutes.</h3>
		<p class="date">10/29/2020 17:34:50</p>
