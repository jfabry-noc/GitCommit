	<h3>jfabry-noc.github.io</h3>
	<p>Moved the music link back to my Apple Music profile.</p>
	<p class="date">11/12/2020 22:53:06</p>
	<h3>CPPushAPI</h3>
	<p>Removed __pycache__ since that was not meant to be committed originally.
Modified the push_configs file provided from CP to allow me to quickly
re-enable the push config while I'm testing the handling of the data.
Updated the listener to start parsing out the data provided from the
hook and create local files for LM.</p>
	<p class="date">11/12/2020 21:09:24</p>

	<h3>CPPushAPI</h3>
	<p>Included the config push script supplied by CP. Updated .gitignore to not include a config_constants file with connection-specific details to import.</p>
	<p class="date">11/12/2020 18:13:07</p>
	<h3>Dashboard</h3>
	<p>Added an indicator to the reboot prompt to let the user know they need to enter Y or N. The code ignores the case.</p>
	<p class="date">11/12/2020 16:44:50</p>

	<h3>Dashboard</h3>
	<p>Updated the periodic displays of what stage the script is at to clearly delineate them from the command outputs. We do not want to suppress the command output, so this just makes it easier to keep tabs on what is executing without excessive hunting.</p>
	<p class="date">11/10/2020 20:10:06</p>

	<h3>Dashboard</h3>
	<p>Added a conditional to the start of the script to check for the uid. If
it isn't 0, which would mean the script was executed with sudo, the user
is notified and the script exits.

Several sections were updated to include -y on apt commands that were
previously missing.

The default php.ini setting includes the " =" after the ";date.timezone"
listing. The sed commands were updated to reflect this.</p>
	<p class="date">11/10/2020 17:50:12</p>
	<h3>LogicMonitorGroovy</h3>
	<p>Merge pull request #3 from jfabry-noc/Bob_test

Bob test</p>
	<p class="date">11/10/2020 16:43:29</p>
	<h3>Dashboard</h3>
	<p>Added a check for the current PHP version. If it's 7.2, the script will add the PPAs and install everything. If it's already 7.4, the script will start straight at the configuration stage.</p>
	<p class="date">11/10/2020 16:03:14</p>

	<h3>Dashboard</h3>
	<p>Modified the parts of the script calling another user account so that all commands can execute under the new user before gracefully exiting back to the original shell without user intervention.</p>
	<p class="date">11/09/2020 22:57:51</p>
	<h3>Dashboard</h3>
	<p>Added the option to specify 'DEV' as a second parameter. If provided, development mode will be enabled. In this mode, the user will be prompted after each stage of the script if they would like to continue or kill the operation. Prevents the script from running amuck when testing it if, for example, the last command executes successfully but does not yield the expected result.</p>
	<p class="date">11/09/2020 21:44:53</p>

	<h3>Dashboard</h3>
	<p>Added sed commands for modifying the php.ini files where a timezone update is necessary. Also added a sed command to escape the backslash in the timezone name so that it can be re-used in another sed command later without escaping.</p>
	<p class="date">11/09/2020 19:38:21</p>
	<h3>Dashboard</h3>
	<p>Added additional installations for the full suite of dependencies. Added a CLI parameter where the timezone must be specified as one value out of an array. Improperly specifying a timezone will result in the options being printed and the script halting. Added a prompt to the very end of the script to reboot the entire server.</p>
	<p class="date">11/09/2020 18:57:18</p>
	<h3>Dashboard</h3>
	<p>Updated the .gitignore file to remove unneeded Python references but to avoid capturing a test script and the .swp files from Vim.</p>
	<p class="date">11/09/2020 16:11:28</p>
	<h3>Dashboard</h3>
	<p>Added a base shell script for updating the PHP components from 7.2 to 7.4</p>
	<p class="date">11/09/2020 16:11:01</p>

	<h3>CPPushAPI</h3>
	<p>Added a different sample route to the listener.</p>
	<p class="date">11/09/2020 14:05:55</p>

	<h3>GitCommit</h3>
	<p>Additional HTML fixes for the tag closing bug.</p>
	<p class="date">11/06/2020 16:36:14</p>
	<h3>GitCommit</h3>
	<p>Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/jfabry-noc/GitCommit into main</p>
	<p class="date">11/06/2020 16:34:53</p>
	<h3>GitCommit</h3>
	<p>Fixed a bug where the paragraph tags for the commit comment were being closed by an h3 tag. I also updated the current entries in the HTML that had been written in this way.</p>
	<p class="date">11/06/2020 16:34:31</p>
	<h3>O365MalwareAlerts</h3>
	<p>Redid the phishing code to move from BatchScript to just script and handle instancing through Active Discovery in LogicMonitor.</p>
	<p class="date">11/06/2020 16:25:23</p>

		<h3>O365MalwareAlerts</h3>
		<p>Modified the script to print only the prefix of the email address to simplify the BatchScript creation process within LogicMonitor.</p>
		<p class="date">11/05/2020 20:32:25</p>
		<h3>O365MalwareAlerts</h3>
		<p>Created a script for a LogicMonitor DataSource to process the phishing results from the local collector's filesystem as a BatchScript. Also updated the .gitignore file to avoid commiting the sample result .csv file.</p>
		<p class="date">11/05/2020 20:02:59</p>

		<h3>O365MalwareAlerts</h3>
		<p>Added a check for an existing result file and removing it prior to starting anything else.</p>
		<p class="date">11/05/2020 16:27:23</p>
		<h3>O365MalwareAlerts</h3>
		<p>Shifted the script to be designed for running as a Scheduled Task or cron job rather than by LogicMonitor directly due to the authentication requirements. Added logging.</p>
		<p class="date">11/05/2020 16:11:27</p>

		<h3>O365MalwareAlerts</h3>
		<p>Created a new script file for querying the O365 quarantine for messages filtered there via transport rule. The script will validate that the appropriate transport rule caught the message (not filterable in the original call) and then report back how many users have received phishing messages blocked this way. Handles the metrics on a month-to-date basis.</p>
		<p class="date">11/04/2020 20:20:44</p>

		<h3>CPPushAPI</h3>
		<p>Added the baseline files that were created for generic webhook listener testing. Also included the sample nginx.conf file for Gunicorn as the Flask + Nginx serving combo.</p>
		<p class="date">11/04/2020 15:03:08</p>
		<h3>CPPushAPI</h3>
		<p>Initial commit</p>
		<p class="date">11/04/2020 12:55:47</p>

		<h3>GitCommit</h3>
		<p>Removed redundant logging when querying each repo for commits. Modified the HTML generation to stop adding an extra newline to the end of the HTML file each time. Removed a repeated line in the HTML file because I forgot how daylight saving time works.</p>
		<p class="date">11/03/2020 13:07:07</p>

		<h3>GitCommit</h3>
		<p>Modified the script to allow for commit messages on the GitCommit repo itself if they aren't the ones automatically generated for the sake of CI/CD to Netlify.</p>
		<p class="date">11/02/2020 22:55:35</p>
		<h3>GitCommit</h3>
		<p>Modified to remove a commit that will become duplicate due to my testing. Again because of the fact that I can't do block comments, apparently.</p>
		<p class="date">11/02/2020 21:35:59</p>
		<h3>GitCommit</h3>
		<p>Fixed yet another bug introduced by my inability to do block comments.</p>
		<p class="date">11/02/2020 21:33:41</p>
		<h3>GitCommit</h3>
		<p>Addressed a bug where I was erroneously doing an extra comparison for the time. This was code from prior to when the filter was applied to the URL. Any returned commits should be considered valid if my account is the author.</p>
		<p class="date">11/02/2020 21:31:00</p>
		<h3>LogicMonitorGroovy</h3>
		<p>Updated the Desk metrics to temporarily include the customer's internal blackhole alias.</p>
		<p class="date">11/02/2020 21:17:56</p>
		<h3>LogicMonitorGroovy</h3>
		<p>Modified the EventSource and corresponding URL filter to account for the job running every 15 minutes rather than every 30 minutes. The time variable is in milliseconds.</p>
		<p class="date">11/02/2020 20:52:56</p>
		<h3>jfabry-noc.github.io</h3>
		<p>Added a new link to gitcommit.gay and updated the CSS to include the alternate GitHub icon for it.</p>
		<p class="date">10/31/2020 18:11:00</p>

		<h3>CPSpeedTests</h3>
		<p>Moved the default timeframe from 60 seconds to a 20 second duration.</p>
		<p class="date">10/30/2020 20:58:51</p>

		<h3>OxidizedBackup</h3>
		<p>Created processing for each child directory in the SharePoint root, correlating it with the hostname of the Dashboard. If there is a match, parse together the new SharePoint URL for uploading the backup tarball and clearing out old tarballs.</p>
		<p class="date">10/29/2020 20:40:38</p>
		<h3>OxidizedBackup</h3>
		<p>Added the ability to query the MS Graph for the contents of a SharePoint directory.</p>
		<p class="date">10/29/2020 18:48:45</p>
		<h3>OxidizedBackup</h3>
		<p>Added skeleton code for handling a connection to the MS Graph and checking the validity of a Graph token. Also added to the repository the Python MSAL package and the dependencies for it.</p>
		<p class="date">10/29/2020 17:41:13</p>
		<h3>LogicMonitorPwsh</h3>
		<p>Modified the hourly collection script to execute every 15 minutes.</p>
		<p class="date">10/29/2020 17:34:50</p>
